## How much will your project match in co-incentives?

(not required but recommended, when applicable):

## Proposal for token distribution:

How will the JIB Token be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.)

- 100,000 JBC (67%) for community airdrop and liquidity mining
- 30,000 JBC (20%) for development and maintenance subgraphs (both https://jibswap.com/ and https://info.jibswap.com/) for first year
- 20,000 JBC (13%) for marketing and management

Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.

Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on JIBChain.

- Airdrop campaign will be lunch on Q1 2024
- Liquidity mining will be lunch on Q1 2024

Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.

Why will incentivized users and liquidity on JIBChain remain after incentives dry up?
